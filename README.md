# Random Pause and Resume YouTube

A throwaway hack.

Loads a YouTube video via the YouTube iframe API. When started,
repeatedly pauses the video for a random period of time and then allows
it to play again for a random period of time.

## Usage

Load the HTML; supply a video ID by the query string parameter `video`.
Start the video playing.
